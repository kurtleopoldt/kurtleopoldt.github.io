	<h3>Site Redesign (in progress) - Jennifer Roop</h3>

	<img src="assets/jen.png" alt="Jen Site Redesign Picture" height="390" width="800">

	<p>Jen wanted her site updated and redesigned to increase her visibility. We worked specifically to make the site beautiful and accessible on all devices including mobile, tablet, and desktop. By improving the layout and look, Jen's website is more professional and accessible to potential clients.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span>Client's Goal:</span> Increase visibility and effectiveness of current site</li>
		<li><span>Solution:</span> Updated site to reflect modern responsive design trends and be more user-friendly</li>

	<h3>GitHub Projects <a href="https://github.com/kurtleopoldt"><img src="assets/GitHub-Mark-32px.png" alt="GitHub logo"></a></h3>

	<p>Below is a list of some of my current GitHub projects and tinkering:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span>Color Game</span></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Originally built from a tutorial, I've extended this project to include different colors and methods of intereaction.</li>
				<li>This highlights my ability to take an existing product, extend it, and add functionality to improve upon its original design.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><span>Library Bookmarklet</span></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Ebooks from the library are a great resource, but in what order should you add them to your queue if there's a hold? This bookmarklet allows you to see how many people are waiting per copy on any ebook.</li>
				<li>This highlights my ability to find an elegant solution to a simple problem. There's no need to over-engineer.</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="about">About</h2>

		<img src="assets/headshot.jpg" alt="Kurt smiling" height="228" width="332">
		
		<p>I've always been interested in computers and technology and am focused on sharing my passion by helping and educating others. My problem solving skills were honed through my formal education as a metallurgical engineer so I am trained to get to the root of any problem before proposing a solution. When I'm not working, I enjoy all that the Pacific Northwest has to offer including hiking, camping, skiing, and simply relaxing at home with my wife and dog.</p>
