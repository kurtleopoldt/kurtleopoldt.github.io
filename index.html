	<h3>Site Redesign - Jennifer Leopoldt</h3>
	<p>Jen wanted her site updated and redesigned to increase her visibility. We worked specifically to make her site beautiful and accessible on all devices including mobile, tablet, and desktops. By improving the layout and look, Jen presents a more visible and effective presence to her clients</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Client's Goal: Increase Visibility and Effectiveness of Current Site</li>
		<li>Solution: Updated site to reflect modern responsive design trends and made it more user-friendly</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>GitHub Projects</h3>
	<p>Here is a list of some of my current GitHub projects and tinkering:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Color Game</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Originally built from a tutorial, I've extended this project to include different colors and methods of intereaction.</li>
				<li>This highlights my ability to take an existing product, extend it, add functionality to improve upon its original design.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Library Bookmarklet</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Ebooks from the library are a great resource, but in what order should you add them to your queue if there's a hold? This bookmarklet allows you to see how many people are waiting per copy on any ebook.</li>
				<li>This highlights my ability to find an elegant solution to a simple problem. There's no need to over-engineer.</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="about">About</h2>

		<img src="assets/headshot.jpg" alt="Kurt smiling" height="152" width="221">
		<p>I've always been interested in computers and technology and am focused on sharing my passion by helping and educating others. My problem solving skills were honed through my formal education as a metallurgical engineer so I am very keen to help get to the root of a problem before proposing a solution. When I'm not working, I enjoy all that the Pacific Northwest has to offer including skiing, hiking, camping, and simply relaxing at home with my wife and dog.</p>
