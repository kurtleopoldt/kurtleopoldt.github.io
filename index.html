<h3>GitHub Projects</h3>
<p>Here is a list of some of my current GitHub projects and tinkering:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Color Game</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Originally built from a tutorial, I've extended this project to include different colors and methods of intereaction.</li>
			<li>This highlights my ability to take an existing product, extend it, add functionality to improve upon its original design.</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Library Bookmarklet</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Ebooks from the library are a great resource, but how should I add them to my queue if there's a hold? This bookmarklet allows you to see how many people are waiting per copy on any ebook.</li>
			<li>This highlights my ability to find an elegant solution to a simple problem. There's no need to over-engineer.</li>

<h2 id="about">About</h2>
	<!-- image here -->
	<p>I've always been interested in computers and technology and have been very focused on sharing my passion by helping and educating others. My problem solving skills were honed through my formal education as a metallurgical engineer so I am very keen to help get to the root of a problem before proposing a solution. When I'm not working, I enjoy all that the Pacific Northwest has to offer including skiing, hiking, camping, and simply relaxing at home with my wife and dog.</p>
